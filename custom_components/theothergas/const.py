# As of v1.8.0 Crowdergy controls each device via a single user-mapped
# entity. When the Crowdergy app flips the device on/off (or, later, the
# smart controller does), the connector writes `value_on` / `value_off`
# to `entity_control`. Replaces the previous typ-specific writable
# entity mappings (entity_is_active / entity_soc_min / entity_soc_max /
# entity_charge_mode) which are no longer used.

# wallbox integration). Distinct from entity_control because the user
# wants three-way manual control rather than a binary on/off mapping.
